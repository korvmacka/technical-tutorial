# Polyglot vs. SpaCy for Natural Language Processing in Swedish #

## Overview ##

Hej och v√§lkommen!

Two popular NLP libraries in the Python sphere are SpaCy and Polyglot. In this tutorial, the performance of both libraries will be discussed with a particular focus on the Swedish language, showcasing its abilities in tokenization, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Named Entity Recognition.

## Introduction to SpaCy and Polyglot ##

SpaCy is an open-source NLP library that provides a wide range of features, including part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and text classification. It is a powerful library designed for production environments. With its focus on performance and ease of use, SpaCy has become a popular choice for building applications that require sophisticated text processing, even for less-resourced languages like Swedish.

Polyglot, on the other hand, is an NLP library whose primary selling point is its extensive language coverage, with well over 130 supported languages in its arsenal, including Swedish. It offers features like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Unlike its SpaCy counterpart, Polyglot offers a sentiment analysis feature.
